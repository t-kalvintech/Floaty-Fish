I made this new game because I was looking through old scratch projects and I found 'Floaty Fish' and I decided to code it in C#.

It's based on or should I say pretty much exactly like the orginal scratch game 'Floaty Fish' except using C# and .NET Window Forms. 

The orginal version as seen below was made when I was in year 7 where I had to make a knock-off version of the classic 'Flappy Bird' game. So I decided to use a fish under the water as a substitute for the bird and the boat/coral for the pipes. It was pretty fun and nostalic coding it as it brought a ton of old memories back to me. Anyway check it out if you want. :/
